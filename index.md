# Static Analysis Demo

<p>In this demo, I performed static malware analysis on a keylogger executable and Python script to identify its functionality and potential threats without executing it. By extracting metadata, analyzing embedded strings, and verifying hashes against threat intelligence databases, I uncovered key indicators of compromise (IOCs) and assessed the malwareâ€™s behavior. <br>

Key Steps:<br>

Keylogger Creation & Analysis: Developed a basic keylogger to understand how malicious keylogging software is structured.<br>

Executable & Python Script Analysis: Examined PE headers and imports.<br>

Hash Analysis: Generated MD5, SHA-256 hashes and cross-referenced them with open-source threat intelligence platforms (VirusTotal).<br>

Embedded String Extraction: Used strings analysis to uncover potential file paths.<br>

Threat Intelligence Correlation: Checked the MD5 hash in public databases to see if it matched any known malware signatures.<br>
Key Takeaways:<br>

Identified static indicators of a keylogger.<br>

Demonstrated low-risk malware analysis techniques that can be applied in real-world security operations.<br>

Validated findings using open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools to strengthen detection capabilities.<br>

## Dynamic Analysis Demo

<p>In this demo, I performed dynamic malware analysis on a keylogger executable and Python script, observing its real-time behavior in a sandboxed environment while also testing its ability to bypass Windows Defender and built-in security mechanisms. This included analyzing process execution, file system modifications, network activity, and anti-virus evasion techniques.<br>

Key Steps:<br>

Safe Execution Environment: Deployed the malware in an isolated virtual machine to prevent host system compromise.<br>
Windows Defender Evasion: Obfuscated the script/executable to avoid signature-based detection.
Used custom packing techniques to prevent AV detection. <br>
Tested execution against Windows Defender and noted bypassed security alerts. <br>
Keylogging Behavior Analysis: Verified that the malware successfully captured keystrokes and logged them without detection.<br>

Key Takeaways:<br>

Successfully bypassed Windows Defender using obfuscation and packing techniques.<br>

Demonstrated how keyloggers operate dynamically, confirming findings from static analysis.<br>

Identified key persistence mechanisms and stealth techniques used by malware.<br>

Gained hands-on experience in behavior-based malware detection and defense evasion tactics.<br>
